**Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

**This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python.**

**How to Play**

The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
One player is 'X' and the other player is 'O'. Players take turns placing their marks in empty squares.
The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
If all 9 squares are filled and neither player has 3 in a row, the game is a draw.
